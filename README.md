### 2. ⚠️ Vulnerabilities & Remediation

| Vulnerability            | Risk Level | Description | Remediation |
|--------------------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Rate Limiting**        | High       | Brute-force attack vector on login | Implement WAF, CAPTCHAs, IP throttling |
| **Remote Code Execution**| Critical   | Arbitrary code execution | Validate input, remove eval-like logic, enforce least privilege |
| **Cross-Site Scripting** | High       | Malicious JS injection | Sanitize input/output, use CSP, HTML encode |

#### 📊 Threat Matrix

| Vulnerability  | Impact     | Likelihood |
|----------------|------------|------------|
| Rate Limiting  | Med–High   | High       |
| RCE            | High       | Medium     |
| XSS            | Med–High   | High       |

### 4. 🔐 API Security

#### Common API Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

| Vulnerability                   | Risk      | Mitigation                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Broken Object Level Auth (BOLA)** | High     | Enforce identity-based access with strict checks (e.g., OAuth2/JWT)         |
| **Lack of Data Encryption**     | Critical  | HTTPS/TLS for data in transit, AES-256 for storage, secure key handling     |
| **Excessive Data Exposure**     | High      | Data minimization, strict response schemas, field-level access control      |

## 🚀 Getting Started

To replicate the assessment process:

1. **Integrate Secure SDLC**: Follow the six-phase lifecycle.
2. **Scan for Vulnerabilities**: Use tools like Trivy and OWASP ZAP.
3. **Fix Issues**: Based on prioritized threat matrix and remediation plans.
4. **Harden APIs**: Secure endpoints and limit data exposure.
5. **Document Findings**: Maintain audit-ready security logs and reports.
